\chapter{CySCA}
	\section{Overview of Challenge}
		The Cyber Security Challenge Australia (CySCA)\footnote{\url{https://cyberchallenge.com.au/}} is a national university level competition set by the Australian Signals Directorate 
		and sponsored by multiple IT, communication and finance companies. 
		The challenge has the goal of ``finding the next generation of Australian Cyber Security talent''.
		This makes this challenge a good starting point for compiling the requirements for a Cyber Security training program. 
	\section{Main Areas of Focus}
		\subsection{Corporate Network Penetration Test}
			This is a step by step Penetration Test of a corporate network. 
			It requires the member to start a DNS enumeration to work out the external systems on the network. 
			The member will then move through a number of systems, 
			until they gain full access to the remote domain and it's DNS server. 

			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				The Chief Visionary Officer would like you to assess the security of the ECWI corporate network and explain the vulnerabilites located to non-technical staff. This will allow ECWI staff to provide sound advice to enterprises. Players should set their DNS server to 192.168.5.53
			\end{quote}

			The following is a breakdown of the skills required to conduct this task:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item DNS enumeration or zone transfer. 
				\item Command Injection
				\item HTTP Directory Traversal. 
				\item Man-in-the-Middle HTTP attack
				\item C\# Reverse Engineering
				\item Hash Cracking
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Web Application Penetration Test}
			This is a penetration test of an Intranet site which is used for most of the communications of the business. 
			This site is also connected to the IT administrative equipment. 
			Succeeding in this challenge starts with a basic understanding of javascript, moving to session hijacking and other more complex web attacks. 
			
			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				The initiative believe their intranet web site is secure due to them using all of the wellness advice that they provide to enterprises. However they are big believers in 'trust but verify' and would like you to verify that the website is secure. You can find the website at http://www.ecwi.cysca
			\end{quote}

			The following is a breakdown of the skills required to conduct this task:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Javascript and information obfuscation. 
				\item Session hijacking.
				\item URL Injection
				\item Cryptography
					%TODO: There may be more. 
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Detect and Defend}
		\subsection{Forensics}
			This section involves both file and network forensics, as well as gathering information on previous attacks. 
			This section starts with a PCAP of an attack in which the country of origin was hidden and moves to Memory analysis to determine the means of the attack. 
			
			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				Following on from a security report, the initiative would like you to use your forensics skills to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing (either internal or external) on their network. Using the following files, find out what is happening and who is behind it. 
			\end{quote}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item PCAP forensics
				\item DOXXING
				\item CVEs and CVE to attack matching
				\item Attack traffic Forensics
				\item Disk/memory Analysis
				\item Attack persistence
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Hash Cracking and Cryptography}
			This section required that the member break a number of hashes and determine weakness in home build cryptography solutions. 
			An understanding of John the Ripper or Hashcat would be a good starting point for this section. 
			However, a stronger understanding of cryptography is necessary in order to break the later challenges. 
			
			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				The initiative provide wellness advice to enterprises and this includes information on choosing a good password. They would like you to see how resistant each of these passwords are to password recovery. The initiative do not have anyone skilled in Cryptography. They would like you to assess some of their secure crypto systems and solve a crypto problem discovered as part of a security response.
			\end{quote}

			It then ends with a C programming and comparison challenge. 
			
			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				There are no reverse engineers in the initiative, however they have a number of systems with incomplete documentation and one backdoored version of their software. They would like you to determine the functionality to allow them to continue to use these services.

			Some of these flaws are well known and obvious, but others are significantly harder to see. 
			This section starts with running a command without python builtins, ending with deobfuscating code and writing python shellcode. 

			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
The initiative's customers use Python heavily, they have created a number of secure python systems for use by enterprises. Please verify that the cloud wellness is suitable on these systems.

		\subsection{Hack the Box}
			This section requires the member to break into a webserver. 
			This server is running a number of services which make it vulnerable to attacks. 
			This attacks starts with a basic Heartbleed credential steal, ending with privilege escalation. 

			The official description of this section is as follows:
			\begin{quote}
				The initiative would like you to assess this machine on their network. They are concerned that it may have a number of high profile vulnerabilities.
			\end{quote}

\chapter{Summary}
	These CTFs cover a wide range of topics due to their differing goals. 
	CySCA covers the broadest range, but at the lowest level. 
	This makes it a good main goal for the CYSEC VECC at the current time due to the low overall level of skill. 
	However, CTFs such as the Boston Key Party and Plaid CTF have been added as good eventual goals for the VECC. 
	These two, in the order that they have been broken down would be good CTFs for the VECC to start working to next year when there are a number of members who have some experience with the activity. 

	Included in table \ref{tab:summary} is the summary breakdown of all of these events. 
	This shows the skills required to complete all of the tasks required for all of these CTFs, as well as the number of times a particular skill comes up and the weighting given to the main category.
