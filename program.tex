\chapter{Introduction}
	This document was written as a one year introductory course to the field of Cyber Security. 
	Within it, is much of the Computer Science and technical information that one requires to start learning in the field. 
	However, this comes with a legal penalty. 
	Much of what you see in this book is illegal to conduct on systems which you do not own or have not received explicit permission to attack. 
	Thus, I request that you read through your local laws before attempting any of the exercises within the book. 
	Furthermore, I recommend setting up a virtual machine which can be used to run these exercises in a controlled environment without an Internet connection. 
	This simply reduces the risk of inputting the wrong command and accidentally attacking a target that you do not control. 

	This document will discuss both the utilization and creation of tools used to attack other systems. 
	As much as possible, it will attempt to develop an understanding of how these tools work and what they do. 
	However, it must be noted that this cannot be guaranteed. 
	Some of the tools which this document will discuss have been crafted into a single click hack, much like a gun. 
	One should remember that without understanding what these tools do, they are not in control. 
	In the same way as a gun in the hands of the untrained, these tools can be dangerous, and should be used with caution. 

	With this in mind, please continue through the pages of this book. 
	I hope you get as much from reading it as I did from writing it.
