\section{Computer Operations}
	A computer can be thought of in terms of the systems which make it up, and the layers of those systems.
	At the base level, a computer is a structure of silicon, etched into the shape of a CPU die, then added into a bus with memory and IO. At the next level, the binary signals which are processed are taken into account, allowing the computer to act in a programmed way. 
	Finally, a computer is programmed in a language such as C or Python. This gives us the interfaces and systems which we interact with daily. 
	\subsection{Hardware}
		\subsubsection{CPU} 
			The CPU is the microprocessor which forms the heart of the modern computer. While not the only microproccessor in a modern computer, they are the most major and the one which is commonly programmed for. This lesson will discuss the current design and implementation of CPUs, and the impact of this on the way that a computer works. 
			This will be broken down into the fetch, decode, execute cycle, the physical units which make up the CPU and the connection which allows it to commuticate with the rest of the computer. 
			\paragraph{Fetch, Decode, Execute Cycle}
				The operation of a computer occurs through the repeated execution of a sequence of instructions. This cycle allows the computer to access the instructions stored in cache or RAM and determine how they should be enacted. This lesson will discuss the approach used on a classic RISC CPU similar to that of most modern phones. Due to this, it will discount cache and threading. 
				\subparagraph{Fetch}
					This step requires the CPU to request the next instruction from it's source. This is possible as the CPU retains the address of the next instruction to complete in it's program counter. 
					After each fetch, the CPU will increment the address in its program counter. However, this address may change due to the requirements of the instruction which was just fetched. 
					If the instruction has to be fetched from RAM rather than cache, the CPU may stall while waiting. This will freeze execution until the fetch cycle has been completed. 
				\subparagraph{Decode}
					This step is performed on the Instruction Decoder, where the instruction which was fetched in the last step is converted into the signals which controll other parts of the CPU to enact the instruction. 
					This decoding will occur based on the instruction set of the processor, which can be thought of as a look-up-table for valid instructions. This will intrepret the first section of the instrcution, known as the opcode, and determine which signals must be sent to have the CPU execute the instruction. The later fields are then sent as arguements to supplement the instruction. 
					This process may take place on a hardwired circuit, or through the use of a microprogram which. In either case the system output will be the same. However, in the latter case, the microprogram will be rewritable, allowing for decoding to be altered after production. 
				\subparagraph{Execute}
					This step causes the CPU to enact the requirements of the instruction, causing output to be written to a given register or memory location. This may occur over multiple clock pulses, with each designating a new section of the instruction. This can be seen through the action of the Arithmetic Logic Unit, which will perform its calculation to ensure that its output is stored in the register by the next clock pulse. 
			\paragraph{CPU Structure}
				The CPU is made up of multiple parts which allow it to conduct its role within the computer. Each of these parts perform only one task within the CPU, allowing others to process or store their output. The most important of these components will be explained here. 
				\subparagraph{The Control Unit}
					Contains the circuitry which intreprets instructions and creates electrical signals which direct other parts of the CPU to carry out the instructions. The control unit is also the communicator between the ALU and the Memory.
				\subparagraph{The Arethmetic Logic Unit}
					(ALU) is the processor for both integer and bitwise logic. The inputs for this circuit are the decoded signals from the Controll Unit, as well as the Operands (arguements) which were passed with the instruction. Once the calculation has taken place, the ALU will output to either the register or memory location designated by the instruction. 
				\subparagraph{The Floating Point Unit}
					(FPU) is the logic circuit used to calculate floating point (real) numbers. While these numbers can be computed using only the ALU, it is not optimized to calculate them. Thus to expediate the process an FPU was created. Thes units will calculate mathematics on real numbers to a given precision (specified by the IEEE). % Reference this
					When a given precision is not supported, the ALU must run the calculation at a far slower pace. 
				\subparagraph{The registers}
					The CPU also contains its own extremely fast memory, known as regsters. These blocks of memory are capable of being used as operands for instructions, and are commonly both the output and the input of a CPU instruction. 
					There are specific uses for registers in the x86 CPU: \footnote{http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~amza/www.mindsec.com/files/x86regs.html}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item General Registers: 
							\subitem RAX is the Accumulator register for IO, arithmetic, interrupt calls, etc. 
							\subitem RBX is the Base Register used as a base pointer for memory access. 
							\subitem RCX is the Counter register, used for loop counters. 
							\subitem RDX is the Data Register used for IO, arithmetic and interrupt calls. 
						\item Segment Registers: 
							\subitem CS holds the current code segment. 
							\subitem DS holds the data segment of the current program. 
							\subitem ES, FS, GS are extra segment registers for far pointer addressing such as video memory. 
							\subitem SS Holds the Stack segment of the current program. 
						\item Index and Pointer Registers: 
							\subitem RSI Source index register for string and memory array copying
							\subitem RDI Destination index register used for string and memory array copying
							\subitem RBP holds the stack base pointer. 
							\subitem RIP is the index pointer. Holds the offset of the next instruction. 
							\subitem RSP is the stack poiner. Holds the current head of the stack. 
						\item CFLAGS holds the current state of the processor and the output or error of some instructions after execution. The use for each CFLAGS bit can be found in table \ref{tab:CFLAGSBits}
